# SAAS Company's Business Solution Website Design Template : 13th Website in pure HTML and CSS

---

## Description
This is a landing page designed for a SAAS based business firm in pure HTML and CSS. The overall design consists of 3 sections. The entire webpage is divided into multiple segments which are the navigation bar, intro section, features section and cards section. All the buttons are designed along with animations.
<br>

Most of the alignment with the elements was done using `Flexbox` and its various properties. In total, I gave `8-9 hours` to build this entire website. In the beginning, I spent a lot of time writing HTML segments where I declared all of the crucial components like the navbar, intro section, card sections, creative team, button designing, footer, and all of their images, and icons. Selecting the correct icons, images, and their size according to the color scheme was one of the challenging tasks for me. Eventually, I spent most of my time designing and maintaining the responsiveness of each object for multiple screen sizes. In this webpage, the responsive breakpoints are at `1024px`, `768px`, and `576px`.
<br>
The image property was an important element that I learned in this project. Correct cropping and aligning of images were necessary for this webpage. This particular project has trained me more on `Flexbox`, `media queries, `images`, and properties along with designing aspects.
